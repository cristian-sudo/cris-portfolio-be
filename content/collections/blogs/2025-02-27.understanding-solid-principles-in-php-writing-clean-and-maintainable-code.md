        text: "As a PHP developer, writing clean and scalable code is crucial for building maintainable applications. One of the best ways to achieve this is by following the SOLID principles—five key design principles that improve the structure and flexibility of your code. In this blog, I'll walk through each SOLID principle, provide simple examples, and share my personal opinion on why they matter."
