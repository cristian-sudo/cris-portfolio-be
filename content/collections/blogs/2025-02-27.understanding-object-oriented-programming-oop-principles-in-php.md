        text: 'As a PHP developer, mastering Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is essential for writing scalable, maintainable, and efficient applications. OOP principles help us structure our code better, making it easier to extend and debug. In this blog, I’ll go over the core OOP principles and share my personal take on why they matter.'
